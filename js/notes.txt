math for curved line with no "kinks": what we want is minimum *radius of curvature*

丿 -> 一
二 -> 大

path options:
1. don't go to edge of circle (this is working fine with large curve handles)
2. find midpoint at edge of circle
  - might be worth returning to path.smooth for this approach
3. extend stroke tips so stroke "flows into place" more cleanly


add kanjivg attribution

interrupt morph:
- set current char to non-kanjivg sentinel
- gather currKanji.strokes from morphStrokes.currStrokes
- item is still currKanji.item I guess

add character queue

add slider for interval time
add slider for handleMin

extract morphStroke into class?
morph options: extension, linear interpolate

make all of this some kind of library, given that we have all the english letters

using object equality check with currKanji and targetKanji could cause problems?
do strokes one-by-one?
