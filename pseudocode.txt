Notes:
this should probably be done in JS somehow so I can throw it around the web.

we need a margin around the central kanji for them all to swoop to,
forming a wagon circle, then swooping in to their new strokes
from back to front.

let SA = len(kanjiA)
find SA equidistant points on circle

for stroke in kanjiA:
  find stroke end
  form worm from stroke with head at stroke end
  set worm to seek its equidistant point
  give initial burst of speed?


update:
  if wagonWheelFormed: // how to quantify this?
    for worm in worms:
      setWormTargets(targetStrokePoints)

  rotate equidistant circle
  seek worms to targets


wormUpdate():
  numTargets = len(targets)
  if numTargets == 0:
    return
  elif numTargets == 1:
    ease towards final target
  else:
    full speed towards next target
